-notes: make more space between solar's for navigation

When outside solar sys keep normal view: 
store large view data
small perspectives 
large spaces 
fast(but not too much) travel. 
Low detail

When inside (position to sun(s) < 1.2x furthest planet to sun(s)):
Replace stored data by sys specific data
hight detail (textures? animations? comets for sure!)
proportionate spaces
slow travel (proportionate)
make larger distances and realistic perspective
?PLANET ORBITING? why not simple (very slow) progress on a circle (midle is sun, diameter is 1/2 distance to sun) (circle angle is defined by initial pos)
